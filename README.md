# Harmonic-Emission-Estimation Tool for Fast-DC-EV-chargers
Fast charging stations (FCSs) are crucial for the rollout of Electric Vehicles (EVs). However, the power quality impact of them is still unknown. To maintain the compatibility of the power grid with massive introduction of FCSs, we need to investigate the potential power quality problems induced by the DC fast chargers. The non-fundamental emission (harmonics, interharmonics, and supraharmonics) noncompliance is one of the most possible problems. 

The harmonic emission estimation tool is thereby developed to provide a cloud based web app that can be used to
- estimate the harmonic emission of a charging station at the design stage when the chargers' design specifications are known,
- estimate the harmonic emission of a charging station at the design stage when the chargers' design specifications are known but the chargers' impedance and harmonic current source is measured at certain charging power,
- and estimate the harmonic emission online when the charging station is operating.

The concept of the tool is illustrated below.
